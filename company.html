                                    <p class="fs-6 text-secondary">The company looked very professional and well managed. The facilitator explained how they collect and study data to help businesses make smart choices. One part of their presentation talked about basic safety awareness, like how to handle wires properly, why octopus wiring is dangerous, and what to do during earthquakes and fire situations. They also shared that they handle customer issues through calls at any time of the day and support people across Asia and even in other parts of the world. Their workplace was quiet and focused which showed how serious they are with their work.</p>

                                    <h1 class="fs-5 mt-5">My Observation</h1>
                                    <p class="fs-6 text-secondary">The staff from MATA Technologies explained what their company does and how they create virtual tours. They let us try their VR setup, where we experienced some famous tourist spots in a virtual way. They also showed us their website, where visitors can view these tourist spots even without using VR. For now they have virtual tours for Cebu and Bohol, and everything looked clear, detailed, and exciting.</p>
                                    <h1 class="fs-5 mt-5">My Learnings</h1>
                                    <p class="fs-6 text-secondary">I learned that technology can help people explore places through both VR and online websites. It makes travel planning easier because tourists can see spots before visiting. I also learned that creating virtual tours takes careful work, from capturing real locations to building them into digital scenes. The visit helped me see how VR and web technology can work together to improve tourism.</p>
